48,,,"<p>It has to be OK to 'tell' at some point, because everything comes back to the fact that you are telling a story.

In general novels will contain more information, more words, and therefore more telling than a short story or a short-short.  Novels are designed to encompass more characters and more action, and so the compression of detail needed for a short story isn't so great.

For every guideline I have written, someone may come up with a counter example.  In general you should not be looking for an excuse to tell.  When you are inclined to tell, see if you could leave the detail out or paint it more concretely with your words.  Still, at some point you have to tell the reader something!  The general point is to prefer the concrete.

I haven't done much writing in some time and thought it would be a fun attempt to jump back into things. So far it's been pretty fun getting back into writing about something I hashed together from a weird dream.</p>

<p>But I'm also woefully under the NaNoWriMo average at 8111 words. Most of my writing happens during my train commutes to and from work via train. I've averaged to about 400ish words a day, which wont get me anywhere near 50,000 in time.</p>

<p><strong>My problem</strong> is that as soon as I get home again, I'm hit by a huge bout of lazyness. My afternoons and weekends are spent slacking off or doing other things around the house. It's not that I don't have things to write; as soon as I sit down at my desk I'm hit by a huge desire to do anything and everything outside of being creative. It's like some sort of lingering nerosis from avoiding homework as a child or something. This sort of thing has also plagued me in the areas of drawing as well.</p>

<p>What should I do to overcome this almost aggressive form of lazyness? Should I rearrange my desk/room? Should I leave my PC off and just focus on my MacBook (the one I use for writing on the train)? Should I go to a different room entirely?</p>

81,,,"<p>Blocking out distractions is the key to doing anything productive. In the case of writing you need to put yourself in a situation where all you can do is write. There are two methods I like to employ, one digital and the other analogue. On my computer I use an application called <a href=""http://pyroom.org/"">PyRoom</a> which places a black fullscreen interface over my entire monitor with only a green box in the middle where I type. There is no option to use it in windowed mode, so you can't see notifications happening in the background. PyRoom is a Linux only application, but the paradigm of blacking out the rest of the screen is one that many application developers build upon.</p>

<p>The other method is to take a notepad somewhere and sit down to write. A good place to go is a coffee shop, or a park, or perhaps even oscillate between both. Being away from your computer like this with a non-interactive medium such as paper is a great way to get yourself focused on the task at hand.</p>

<p>In both cases, some lyricless music is also good. It stops your mind from picking up on every little noise that is happening around you.

<p><strong>No.</strong></p>

153,,,"<p>Unexpected twists can work in plot driven novels where the readers are expecting to move quickly - but without a lot of mental effort or interest in the characters - through a story.  Your example author Dan Brown writes pretty much the same characters in every novel.  He also spins absolutely fascinating mysteries that people must know the end of.</p>

<p>Plot twists can also feel cheap to the reader.  For example, O. Henry's short stories seem a little less than serious because as a reader you go along through the story until you get to a plot twist at the very end that you didn't see coming at all.  Instead of being able to see yourself as clever for anticipating this twist you feel like the author held important pieces of information from you.  If you do a plot twist, you have to give the readers clues along the way to the twist that it is coming, dropping hints of what it will be.  This keeps your reader engaged.  Edith Wharton does this in an absolutely stunning way in her short story ""<a href=""http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/ewharton/bl-ewhar-roman.htm"">Roman Fever</a>.""

What do they fear?  What is making their fears realized?  Write a compelling character.  Make your readers care about him or her.  Take one of his or her deepest desires and thwart it.  Bring it all to a conclusion where the character changes - his or her desires change, he or she breaks from the hope deferred, whatever you like.  You'll have engaged readers.</p>

<p>Your work must be <em>your</em> work. Don't submit anything that someone else has written, not even if you just copied a few sentences. Even if you changed them. There are companies out there that can run automated checks on your work to see if they can find something in it that even remotely looks like someone else wrote it. If that happens, your reputation can be ruined before it even started.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not really. Think about it from the thieves point of view. If you work is bad, it won't sell so it doesn't make sense to steal it. If it's good, and they make a fortune, you will surely sue to get your money. Chances are that you will make it in court.</p>

<p>Either way, if your work is incredibly good or bad, there is only a small chance that someone will steal it. Stop worrying, put your energy into making your work better.</p>

<p>There is no International law and you should be happy about that. Copyright is a tool to make <em>publishers</em> rich, not you.</p>

<p>In 1800 in Germany, there was no copyright. England, OTOH, had a very strict copyright. The net effect: Ten times more books were published in Germany, they were cheap and many authors could live from their work (high demand for books -> better bargaining power for authors).</p>

<p>In England, only a few authors could live from their work, books were very expensive (one quarter of your monthly income for a single book).

<li><p>With copyright, no one can publish your work against your will. So you can create an artificial demand, which drives prices up. But only for those who are in demand. If anyone can print any book, authors can't sit back. They have to write more and more books. So that's better for the readers: Fewer books will go out of print.</p>

<p>Now you'll argue that authors won't get any money if anyone can pirate their work any time.</p>

<p>How so? If a book isn't published at all, no one can pirate it. So only published books can be pirated. When a book is published, you need to make a copy of it (scanning, proof-reading, etc). So pirating isn't free, it costs money, too. And time. Eager fans will buy the book as soon as possible, so the author will always get money from the first time publisher. But since there is no copyright, the author can have their book printed by a second publisher, too - and get money from two sources.</p>

<p>If a publisher doesn't want to ask for permission, well, you can't force them. There is nothing preventing them to print any book. But there must be a market, too. So their copy must have some unique value to the readers. Maybe its much cheaper.</p>

<p>As an author that gets me thinking: ""If my current publisher is so expensive, that means fewer people buy my books <strong>and</strong> I could get more per copy if that other publisher printed it ..."" Not something your publisher will want to hear, I'm sure.</p>

<p>If your publisher offers you better service than the ""cheap pirate"", you can still stay. But now, it's a <em>decision</em>, not something forced by the law.

248,,,"<p>I'm going to go ahead and disagree, and I'll tell you why. The problem with telling, with clarity, is that you're no longer letting the reader's imagination do the work. Clarity is great for technical documentation, but a lot of highly regarded fiction is anything but clear. Hell, if you're a postmodernist, then <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=8iS04PaSssQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=ulysses&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5rllbHvD4n&amp;sig=qj_9k7YYXnymPy6hYDep60ti53Y&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=oS3nTOO8McT7lweuxOmeCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false"">clarity is your enemy</a>. You fight it to the death.</p>

<p>To take a simple example, think about horror movies, and horror fiction. How scary is it when you actually <i>see</i> the monster clearly? It's usually a bit of a joke at that point. But that precious time when the monster is hidden? When all you catch is the fleeting glimpse, all you know of it is its sinister handiwork? That's magic. That's where all the scary comes from.</p>

<p>It's just like that with character description and character interaction. You need to have the reader filling in the blanks themselves to really engage them. They're going to do a much better job of pulling <em>themselves</em> into the story than you ever could, and you have to give them that space. Hell, even scenery description is better when it's vague(1). </p>

<p>Don't ever say, ""Such and such is boring. Such and such is annoying. So and so is sad. So and so is happy. So and so is socially inept."" It's quick, it's clear, it's <em>boring</em>. Those things are easy to show via dialog and description. Show them, and give the reader the space to empathize, and to color the scene with their imagination.</p>

<p>1) My favorite example is from <em><a href=""http://www.yankeeclassic.com/miskatonic/library/stacks/literature/lovecraft/novellas/colouro.htm"">The Colour out of Space</a></em> by Lovecraft.

They may be trademarked but only if the literary work/movie/or a related product were named after the character.  So, trademark would only come into play for secondary characters in widely merchandised works.   In theory you'd be completely safe as long as your characters aren't similar to characters of the same name, and they aren't widely known characters.
There's an interesting essay here.  Here is one of the key points respecting copyright:
Copyright:

to warrant copyright protection, a
  fictional character must be
  specifically described and fully
  developed. At times overcoming this
  ""description hurdle"" may be difficult
  to achieve. This is because some
  courts are very skeptical of
  protecting ""word portraits"" since they
  are unable to ""see"" the differences
  between one fictional character and
  another.

276,,,"<p>After short brainstorming and small talk with myself, here is what I got:</p>

<p>1) You are inventing the next part of arc while working on current.</p>

<p>While writing I frequently experienced a feeling that told me: ""Yes, I'm going to use this in the further scene\book"". If you feel so, you already should have a next-things list, and put all resembling feelings there. If you haven't got that list, then acquire one.</p>

<p>That is the simplest ""technique"" available and I think you should use it instead of anything else.</p>

<p>2) One big arc for all novels.</p>

<p>That's it, you've got to invent a one big arc. And you are not going to write a word in any of your novels, belonging to this arc, until you've finished it. I think this plan should be used only for ""project-of-my-life"" type of things. If you're not going to make something as epic as ""The Lord of The Rings"", don't bother.</p>

<p>I think the comparison with the World War II will be appropriate:</p>

<ul>
<li>WWII was the one whole world massacre, that changed people mind-basis. (One big integral thing, your arc);</li>
<li>Campaigns of WWII are your novels (or even series of novels, if you will look to Eastern Front);</li>
<li>Belligerents and neutral countries are your characters;</li>
<li>Battles are your plot, and key battles are your culminating points;</li>
<li>Local conflicts and controversies are your fillers (and you should not give them much attention).</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem here, you have to look through the eyes of all your participants to see the big picture. And yet you are not going to fully discern it.</p>

<p>I hope you got me.</p>

<p>The sweet part of series-writing and desired talent of every bad TV-show script writer is the scheduling talent. But their scheduling is different from standard project-manager scheduling. I guess that subject I'm going to talk about is one of TV-showers community dirty little secrets.</p>

<p>What do we know about TV-shows and series? Well, the Dumas ""Three Musketeers"" was a series one day, wasn't it? Series have many peculiarities, and one of them is that scripters should give some hooks to future cases in the universe they creating. </p>

<p>But you should consider that hooking may quickly turn into a big disaster, if you will try to bind something to every of your previous hooks. If you have many related events, your bond would be looking awful, unnatural and made up out of whole cloth. ""Lost"" TV-show looked bad in the end because of too many ties. So did ""Prison Break"" script. I think 80/20 rule is appropriate here: with 20% of hooks you bind to something and 80% of hooks you leave unused.</p>

What techniques can be used to invent such phrases? Sometimes they just ""fall out"" while you're writing, but other times require intense effort. You could do things like throw random words or direct opposites together and see if that inspires something, but I suspect this has a relatively low return on investment (time wise).
What successful techniques have you used?

300,379,3,"<p>Most Crime/Thriller Novels usually have a sudden, unexpected plot twist that puts the main character in a really hopeless situation.</p>

<p>One way to resolve this is by using a ""Deus Ex Machina"", that is a character that suddenly appears out of nowhere and has the solution. It could be that FBI Agent who is part of secret government project, the secretary of your enemy that gives you access to some codes, a long lost friend/relative who was believed to be dead, or the wife/child of the enemy.</p>

<p>I see the appeal of DXM resolutions as they don't require much preparation and are seemingly surprising, but nowadays I just find them annoying. But on the other hand, they do offer to introduce a completely new scenario for the rest of the story. That FBI Agent allows us to show a whole secret government facility, the lost relative has a hiding place somewhere, and the secretary/wife/child gives us an entry into the facilities of the enemy. Also it allows to bring in a ton of new people easily.</p>

<p>If on the other hand we introduce the saviour early in the story and have him/her resolve the hopeless situation, it feels a bit boring. It is hard to introduce new people and places if they have to be attached to the early-introduced sidekick, which leads to a reaction like ""If you had an Uncle that can do that, why didn't you already go to him 150 pages ago when you first encountered that problem?"". Also it then feels a bit like a journey, constantly watching 2 or 3 characters - a bit like the Sherlock Holmes novels that only had these two.</p>

<p>There is nothing wrong with Sherlock Holmes of course (Especially since it was written in the 1880's), but I'm trying to understand how people like Ken Follet manage to avoid this effect mostly.</p>

<p>The idea behind morning pages is more than just freewriting. When the author explains it, and what to do, it's:</p>

<p>First, yes, freewrite at least three pages of what's in your head, but more importantly, don't reread what you write for at least one year after you write it.</p>

<p>When we wake up in the morning, there's enough cruft in our heads (either from dreams, good or bad things that are happening in our lives) and we continue to dwell on that cruft throughout the day. Having that cruft prevents us from performing as well as we should, and as writer's prevents our creativity from being pure as it should. If we reread what we wrote, we simply reinforce the cruft. However, by writing our thoughts down and getting them out, we clear are heads to be able to do the things we really want it to do.</p>

<p>Personally, morning pages seemed more like early morning meditation than freewriting for an idea.</p>

<p>However, and she goes into this in the book as well ... If every morning yo clear your head so you don't have any cruft, you'll wake up one morning, and you'll realize that your mind just feels free, and then when you write, it'll be coming from your imagination.</p>

<p>The author goes on to give an example of a fiction writer who had had writer's block for months, and had been so caught up on personal issues she had been having that she couldn't focus enough on just being creative. After a few months of writing morning pages and removing that cruft, she realized that what she was writing was becoming a new character, and, essentially, a new story.</p>

Sometimes this can be good, but there are notable instances where the author clearly needs an editor riding herd on him, and doesn't get it...To the detriment of the finished product(1).
So, for a standard mass-market paperback, you're probably going to see the text fall squarely in the 400-500 page range. Exceptions happen, but they're rare. For more established authors, the sky is the limit.
1) The best example I can think of is Stephen King's The Stand. The original version was tight and punchy, but, once he got famous enough, he had it reprinted with about 300 extra pages that added nothing to the plot, which he felt had been pulled unfairly by his editor. The difference, however was between ~800 pages and ~1100 pages, so clearly even Stephen King of 1978 had enough pull to get an 800 page novel published.

363,,,"<p>Two tips:</p>

<p><strong>You are not your story.</strong> Your story may really, really suck. However, that doesn't mean that you're a bad writer or that you'll never write anything worth reading. It just means that this particular story needs work. If you're ever going to have a measure of success as a writer, you have to learn to disassociate your self-esteem from negative feedback you get about any particular story.</p>

<p>Which leads to:</p>

<p><strong>Allow your writing to suck.</strong> Guess what? Pretty much everyone's first drafts suck. Second drafts, too. You may have to go through ten drafts to get to the one that works. You may also have to go through ten terrible short story ideas before you start writing the one that's going to be great.

You are not your story. Your story may really, really suck. However, that doesn't mean that you're a bad writer or that you'll never write anything worth reading. It just means that this particular story needs work. If you're ever going to have a measure of success as a writer, you have to learn to disassociate your self-esteem from negative feedback you get about any particular story.
Which leads to:
Allow your writing to suck. Guess what? Pretty much everyone's first drafts suck. Second drafts, too. You may have to go through ten drafts to get to the one that works. You may also have to go through ten terrible short story ideas before you start writing the one that's going to be great.

<p>The biggest questions you need to answer about your characters are along the lines of the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>What does she want most out of this situation?</li>
<li>What is his deepest fear?</li>
<li>What does she love?</li>
<li>What does he hate?</li>
<li>What motivates her to do [thing]?</li>
<li>What does he want from her?</li>
</ol>

<p>Basically you need to find the motivations for your characters' actions.</p>

<p>Beyond that your biography should fit naturally with the motivation.  If your character fears technology will ultimately render humans useless, how interesting would it be to have him pulled into a tech support role at work unwillingly?  If your protagonist has an omnipresent fear of death, a serious allergy to peanuts would provide a great tension in the story.</p>

399,,,"<p>Time is based on an Event. We are in the year 2010 because someone inaccurately took the birth of Jesus Christ as the base (hence b.c. And a.d. denominations). Other cultures have other years, I believe either the China or the Arabian countries have a completely different year.</p>

<p>In the Star Wars Extended Universe, the battle of Yavin is the base for their calendar. That was the destruction of the first Death Star, and you will find dates given as ""4000 BBY"" (Before battle of Yavin) or ""130 ABY"" (after battle of Yavin)</p>

<p>A calendar is only there to put events into perspective, and mainly for the reader. How long is a year? Most fictional works still use the earth year, or the character says something like ""it happened 8000 years ago,in your culture that's 200 earth years""</p>

<p>Sometimes you don't need to have an absolute year. It doesn't matter if you are in the year 2000 or 5128, because it's just a number. Maybe you just start telling your story and when you refer to past/future events, you just use relative time: He was born 200 earth years before he met the girl of his dreams. The galactic elections will be in 2 months from now, and the elected chancellor will be in office for 5 years. With this description you just set an ""epoch"": a man and woman meet. All other dates are relative to this point in time, wherever it is.</p>

<p>Basically, you can just make up a number. Pick an event, either one that happens in the story or one that has/had a great impact on the fictional universe. You don't have to give that date to the reader if you don't want to, but it will help you greatly to keep consistency, otherwise you will encounter that a character is too old or that an event happened too long ago to be witnessed by your character. Having a calendar helps greatly.</p>

<p>Some Universes did fine without a consistent calendar.Star Trek's Star Date for example is completely inconsistent between the various incarnations and doesn't translate. Most people don't care, I think it's sloppy.</p>

<p>So my recommendation: pick an event as your epoch (year 0), plan all other events against this one, and decide if you want to disclose it to the reader or if you just want to give relative dates based on that event. You can have both options of course: year 0 is when the war ended and the first chancellor reunited the tribes, but your story happens 500 years later when your character meets his future wife when he tries to rob her store, and all events you describe in the book are relative to the failed robbery.</p>

You don't have to give that date to the reader if you don't want to, but it will help you greatly to keep consistency, otherwise you will encounter that a character is too old or that an event happened too long ago to be witnessed by your character. Having a calendar helps greatly.
Some Universes did fine without a consistent calendar.Star Trek's Star Date for example is completely inconsistent between the various incarnations and doesn't translate. Most people don't care, I think it's sloppy.
So my recommendation: pick an event as your epoch (year 0), plan all other events against this one, and decide if you want to disclose it to the reader or if you just want to give relative dates based on that event. You can have both options of course: year 0 is when the war ended and the first chancellor reunited the tribes, but your story happens 500 years later when your character meets his future wife when he tries to rob her store, and all events you describe in the book are relative to the failed robbery.

Moreover, if you don't use ""rocket across the room"", you would end up with a somewhat plain narration, or you'd have to invent equivalent expressions in ""ancient"" English, in which case your reader could have a hard time interpreting your made-up sayings. A good compromise would be to substitute more neutral expressions, such as ""flew across the room"" as Maulrus suggested.

There are many books that have a segment along the lines of ""As they were riding the train to Lyon, he couldn't help but to look at her and her perfect auburn hair.

It was the graduation party at her brothers house..."" and from there you're in the middle of a flashback that serves as introduction.</p>

<p>Crime Novels can benefit from this as well.

440,,,"<p>Well, even without studying some dubious horoscopic sciences as feng shui, everybody at least feels that having your own work place for each kind of work you're doing is a significant efficiency boost. I think undisturbable place to write is not an option — it is a precondition. Once you have it, you can begin to write and at least be sure that you'll <em>finish</em> your work. But there are also some modifications that could help even more.</p>

<p><strong>1. Dual monitors.</strong></p>

<p>The most powerful boost for everybody who's writing or drawing something with help of the computer. I contrive a new usage for them every week or two for all fringes of my doings. Here are some examples that I just invented or used before: </p>

<ul>
<li>Drawing a fantasy map based on text or back to front;</li>
<li>Looking to wikipedia while writing about tough subjects (i.e medical drugs);</li>
<li>Modifying text from one screen on another;</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Cup of a drink.</strong></p>

<p>You've already knew it before :) But I'll add my pair of cents. I think people underestimate smells. There are not so many people working in a smell or taste art, but this <em>is</em> art. And changing taste of a drink lying in front of you will often reflect good on your creativity.

I think undisturbable place to write is not an option — it is a precondition. Once you have it, you can begin to write and at least be sure that you'll finish your work. But there are also some modifications that could help even more.
1. Dual monitors.
The most powerful boost for everybody who's writing or drawing something with help of the computer. I contrive a new usage for them every week or two for all fringes of my doings. Here are some examples that I just invented or used before: 

Drawing a fantasy map based on text or back to front;
Looking to wikipedia while writing about tough subjects (i.e medical drugs);
Modifying text from one screen on another;
...

2. Cup of a drink.
You've already knew it before :) But I'll add my pair of cents. I think people underestimate smells. There are not so many people working in a smell or taste art, but this is art. And changing taste of a drink lying in front of you will often reflect good on your creativity. So go and buy that new sort of black, green, red, white, {put your colour here} tea or learn how to make a mocha at last.

<p>Take as example the movie <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110912/"">Pulp Fiction</a>. There is a character which is shot during the movie (I do not want to spoil).

<p>I think that Tarantino made that crystal clear. This scene is introduced like a new chapter. Nevertheless there a lot of people who did not get, why this character is now alive again. They could not follow that jump into the past.</p>

<p>So even if you think the readers should be able to follow your flashback, some won't. That does not mean you shouldn't do it. It means, you should be aware, that these readers will close your book and say ""Man, what a stupid plot. That sucks!"". You cannot satisfy them all.</p>

466,,,"<p>From <a href=""http://2nfactory.blogspot.com/2008/10/7-creative-principles-of-pixar-by-john.html"">7 creative principles of Pixar</a>:</p>

<p><strong>1) Never come up with just one idea.</strong> Regardless of whether you want to write a book, design a piece of furniture or make an animated movie: At the beginning, don't start with just one idea - it should be three.</p>

<p>The reason is simple. If a producer comes to me with a proposal for a new project, then usually he has mulled over this particular idea for a very long time. That limits him. My answer always reads: 'Come again when you have three ideas, and I don't mean one good and two bad. I want three really good ideas, of which you cannot decide the best. You must be able to defend all three before me. Then we'll decide which one you'll realise.'</p>

<p>The problem with creative people is that they often focus their whole attention on one idea. So, right at the beginning of a project, you unnecessarily limit your options. Every creative person should try that out. You will be surprised how this requirement suddenly forces you to think about things you hadn't even considered before. Through this detachment, you suddenly gain new perspectives. And believe me, there are always three good ideas. At least.</p>

<p><strong>2) Remember the first laugh.</strong> A big problem in the creative process is related to the enhancement of your ideas,"" cautions Mr Lasseter. ""Revising, retouching, refining is very important, but it carries a danger.</p>

<p>""If you have a story, a joke, a thought, which you write down, it loses its effect over time. It wears itself out. When you hear a joke for the second time you still laugh heartily, on the third or fourth occasion already less so, and when you hear it the hundredth time, you hate it.</p>

<p>I say to my authors: 'Take notice of the first laugh, write it down if necessary.' This may at times be bothersome, but it is important. Many times, good things got lost because people could not remember anymore how it felt when they heard the idea for the first time.""</p>

468,,,"<p>The tricky act to walk with telling stories from a non-humanoid perspective is that of combining the traits your readers <em>expect</em> from that animal or object with the traits readers <em>expect</em> from a narrator.  With animals this means getting inside the {dolphin|wolf|horse|whale}'s head.  It means knowing that a horse lives life poised between flight and fight.  It means knowing that dogs and wolves sleep much less deeply than humans.  It means using all the animal science available.  It also works best with more intelligent animals.  Examples would include:</p>

<ul>

<p>With inanimate objects you have a bit more freedom, because you are creating a personality and intelligence level for something people have fewer preconceptions of in terms of personality.  At the same time, there is a reason many books with inanimate narrators are written for children - it's hard to make this completely believable.  Sometimes a third person omniscient narrator might step into an object (for example, something watching a changing world throughout centuries), but other than that you don't get a whole lot of examples for adults.  When they are used in literary fiction for adults the purpose is often mostly to make a point about the human characters or the readers.</p>

Realize that the QWERTY keyboard wasn't designed ultimately for speed (most of us are right-handed but the major keys are in the left hand), but since most people learn to type that way, it's tough to switch.
That said, I couldn't imagine having to hunt-and-peck to actually capture a story I'm working on.  I get frustrated enough with the mistakes I make as I touch-type.
As far as touchscreen technology, again if it's set up like QWERTY, I can't imagine it's going to make that much difference for speed, accuracy, or ultimate ""text quality"".

510,,,"<p>Psychological research suggests that personality type is correlated to word patterns (Pennebaker &amp; Graybeal, 2001). Personality is also known to be strongly related to creativity (Wolfradt &amp; Pretz, 2001). Some aspects of personality (neuroticism, extraversion) can be accurately judged from writing (Argamon, Dhawle, Koppel &amp; Pennebaker, 2005).</p>

Your first draft is always (no matter if your name is Stephen King or Jakub Hampl) a big pile of shit! Yes, it is. Writing means re-writing. Again and again and again. Your approach is exactly how writing works. Plot down and loop through your refinement process.
James Frey wrote an anecdote in the first or second book of his ""How to Write a Damn Good Novel"" series. Year after year a woman came to his writing class, who showed that she was totally untalented. He was asking himself, why she didn't give up. But she was stubborn. And she got better every year. Lastly she published a novel which was a success. In opposite to many more talented participants, who knew they were good, but didn't turn that benefit into any real outcome.
Hard work always beats talent!

"
572,,,"<p>Why do you want to be a writer? No offense, seriously. But for me, I want to write because stories come to me and need to be written. It's not ""I want to be writer"" so then I have to struggle with how to be a writer and then struggle with what I want to say (since writers have to say something) and then struggle with story ideas, all so I can be a 'writer'.</p>

<p>For me it's more just going through my day, watching and participating in life, something happens, or I reflect on something, and suddenly the idea for a story pops into my head. I spend some time thinking about it and it grows, then I have to write it down.</p>

<p>Do you want to write, or be a 'writer'?  They're different. Here, let's look at your questions.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do you have any advice for
  overcoming the fear of failure/being
  terrible?</p>
  
  <p>Do you have any thoughts on how to craft a plan for becoming a writer and
  actually    getting things done beyond
  brainstorming? (What should ""step one""
  be?)</p>
  
  <p>How do you read masters of the genre (I started reading John Le Carre
  today) that interests you in a way
  that doesn't lead to the reaction,
  ""I'll never be this good, so why try?""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>1) You shouldn't worry about pleasing anonymous strangers. Try to write stuff that you think is good. Then show it to people and listen to feedback. Some will be good and some will be bad. Learn to distinguish. If you write based on 'fear of failure' you will base your writing on trying to figure out what will be popular. That's the surest way to fail that there is. You're an artist. An artist is one mind, one vision. Listen to yourself.  The key to being a writer is trusting your own judgment about what is good. If you keep looking to other people to tell you about your own writing, you'll fail.</p>

<p>2) Plan for becoming a writer? Ok, here: Write a book, get it published. That's it. At that point, you're a professional writer. If you mean a plan on how to write, here it is: you sit down at your computer and write. If you don't know what to write, then you need to think about it. There's no substitute for thinking. If you want to write thrillers, then think of a cool thriller plot.</p>

<p>Here, I'll give you one I thunk up 10 seconds ago: A woman wakes up to discover she's undergone a sex change operation and is now a man. More, her whole family has been murdered. She discovers that she is part of a UN experiment on gender meant to unify the sexes into one unisex type and relegate all reproduction to the authority of the UN, part of their evil plan to take over the world. </p>

<p>Could you take that, or some idea you thunk up, and turn it into a book? If not, why not. What I just wrote is the kernel of a thriller story that you, as a thriller writer, will think up, fill out, and turn into a book. When you get an idea for a book, it will take that form. That's what an idea for a story looks like.</p>

<p>3) No, I never think ""I'll never be this good."" because I never think that writing has only one measure, one dimension. Le Carre  has his strengths and weaknesses. So does any writer. Personally, I think Le Carre's characterization is weak. I don't find his people worth knowing. Again, I keep coming back to one thing: what do <strong>you</strong> want to say? What do you want people to feel when they put down your book? Do you have any idea? </p>

<p>Why do you want to be a writer?</p>
",,2,,2010-11-30T09:00:12.957,,605,2010-11-30T12:44:46.577,2010-11-30T12:44:46.577,,7,,190,583,2,14,,,,"Why do you want to be a writer? No offense, seriously. But for me, I want to write because stories come to me and need to be written. It's not ""I want to be writer"" so then I have to struggle with how to be a writer and then struggle with what I want to say (since writers have to say something) and then struggle with story ideas, all so I can be a 'writer'.
For me it's more just going through my day, watching and participating in life, something happens, or I reflect on something, and suddenly the idea for a story pops into my head. I spend some time thinking about it and it grows, then I have to write it down.
Do you want to write, or be a 'writer'?  They're different. Here, let's look at your questions.

Do you have any advice for
  overcoming the fear of failure/being
  terrible?
Do you have any thoughts on how to craft a plan for becoming a writer and
  actually    getting things done beyond
  brainstorming? (What should ""step one""
  be?)
How do you read masters of the genre (I started reading John Le Carre
  today) that interests you in a way
  that doesn't lead to the reaction,
  ""I'll never be this good, so why try?""

1) You shouldn't worry about pleasing anonymous strangers. Try to write stuff that you think is good. Then show it to people and listen to feedback. Some will be good and some will be bad. Learn to distinguish. If you write based on 'fear of failure' you will base your writing on trying to figure out what will be popular. That's the surest way to fail that there is. You're an artist. An artist is one mind, one vision. Listen to yourself.  The key to being a writer is trusting your own judgment about what is good. If you keep looking to other people to tell you about your own writing, you'll fail.
2) Plan for becoming a writer? Ok, here: Write a book, get it published. That's it. At that point, you're a professional writer. If you mean a plan on how to write, here it is: you sit down at your computer and write. If you don't know what to write, then you need to think about it. There's no substitute for thinking. If you want to write thrillers, then think of a cool thriller plot.
Here, I'll give you one I thunk up 10 seconds ago: A woman wakes up to discover she's undergone a sex change operation and is now a man. More, her whole family has been murdered. She discovers that she is part of a UN experiment on gender meant to unify the sexes into one unisex type and relegate all reproduction to the authority of the UN, part of their evil plan to take over the world. 
Could you take that, or some idea you thunk up, and turn it into a book? If not, why not. What I just wrote is the kernel of a thriller story that you, as a thriller writer, will think up, fill out, and turn into a book. When you get an idea for a book, it will take that form. That's what an idea for a story looks like.
3) No, I never think ""I'll never be this good."" because I never think that writing has only one measure, one dimension. Le Carre  has his strengths and weaknesses. So does any writer. Personally, I think Le Carre's characterization is weak. I don't find his people worth knowing. Again, I keep coming back to one thing: what do you want to say? What do you want people to feel when they put down your book? Do you have any idea? 
Why do you want to be a writer?

I find Scrivener a very streamlined piece of software for writers and am happy with it. I use it for almost all my writing.

<p>Issac Asimov's collection ""Gold"" has an essay called ""Originality.""  In the essay, Asimov says that his most original story was probably nightfall ... at least he thought it was, until 20-odd years later he read an old magazine he had read as a child ... and noticed the same plot line!</p>

<p>It happens.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the classic ""rip off"" of fantasy is Lord of the Rings was ripped off by the Sword of Shannara - consider <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sword_of_Shannara#Sword_and_The_Lord_of_the_Rings"" rel=""nofollow"">this Wikipedia article</a>.
So if I were worried about something like that, the first thing I would do is to find two peers who were deep into the genre, maybe a third who was into ""general"" literature.  Then I would ask /them/ to read the plot outline and express any concerns.</p>

<p>So why did Asimov get away with it and Terry Brooks got hammered?</p>

<p>One, Terry Brooks ripped off a /recent best seller/.  Two, Terry Brooks ripped off the world /AND/ the plot.  Three, Terry Brooks didn't really include any character development -- his characters were wooden.  Four, Terry Brooks did not include any twists or real changes, whereas Asmimov did.</p>

<p>So you might borrow some elements from various stories.  The problem is if you don't contribute anything original.  To borrow one of my favorite lines from a co-worker about fantasy ""Look, it's a fantasy novel man.  You're going to have an enemy that needs to be defeated, so you have to find an object - a sword or something - to defeat him.  But to find the sword you need to find the map, or find the old lady with the clue, or whatever.  It's your classic 'quest', it's been done a million times.  So why do you read it?  CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, man, that's the difference between a terrible fantasy novel and a good one.  (I believe was talking about R.A. Salvatore, probably the icewind dale trilogy.)</p>

<p>For a lot more about originality, I'd highly recommend the essay ""originality"" from Asimov in his anthology ""Gold."" You can probably get it free from inter-library loan or on <a href=""http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B0046LUCGG"" rel=""nofollow"">Amazon</a>.</p>

611,,,"<p>I've been writing since I was very young.  Honestly, its true what they say.  Just as we grow as individuals as we age and experience life, so too does our craft as writers mature as we work at it.  Most writers have to work at or massage the text to make it the way they want it to be.  </p>

<p>I once came across some prose I wrote back before I was even in High School. It was utter crap.  Later found some writing from nearly 14 years ago, it was crap too.  What does that mean?  It means we learn as we do as writers.  There is no substitute for writing.  </p>

<p>So you get an idea what do you do?  First carry a note book and pen with you at all times.  I have a little pocket size compositions book I carry with me and try to jot ideas down in for writing.  That helps a ton.  Write till you've got the ideas out of your head.  Then later pick them up, revise, expand or ignore if you decide they aren't worth continuing.</p>

<p>Then when you find time, write, write about whatever comes in your head.  I once saw a guy who wrote fifteen hundred words just on the grooming routine of this one character.  It was crazy!  But at least he was writing.  </p>

<p>I've been writing, for quite some time now, and while I've not had anything yet I want to publish, I've found that I have grown as I've written.  I've mentored other young writers, and I always tell them to write as often as they can.  The more time you spend writing, the better it becomes.</p>

<p>As for how to improve your writing?  Get a grammar handbook.  Review the rules of the English language.  Then read!  Read a lot of different genres and styles.  There are so many ways to express an idea.  Relish it, experiment, and then don't be afraid to try new ideas of constructing your writing when you have the time.</p>

<p>Ultimately there is no substitute for sitting down and doing it.  One more thing, sometimes it helps to find a muse, a focus.  Maybe its cooking, maybe its science fiction, or history, whatever it is find a subject and start writing.  Look online for others who are interested in writing similar things.

Unfortunately though, it is only available on Mac and now a beta-version for Windows PC. I still mention it in case anyone on any of those platforms interested in the question ends up here, as the title doesn't mention the Linux-specificity. I wrote more about Scrivener in my answer to this question: <a href=""https://writers.stackexchange.com/questions/9/is-there-a-special-software-for-writers/636#636"">Is there a special software for writers?</a> </p>

<p>A piece of software I heard is very similar in features, and is supported on the Linux platform as well, is <a href=""http://www.writerscafe.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Writer's Cafe</a>. I cannot compare them myself, as I lack any experience with the latter, but it should be worth testing out.</p>

<p>Even though I cannot directly help with Linux software, I will elaborate on analog options. These will always be less streamlined than using dedicated software, as the organization has to be done manually.</p>

<p>The best way would be to have folders with printed out/jotted down text, organized by project. So, if you have a scene that you want to use in a certain project, only later on, get it on a piece of paper and file it in the folder. You then always know where to look. It is also a good idea to color-mark, or otherwise mark the papers for sub-sorting, and you can clip small cards with a synopses in the top corner for even more clarity. Again, the exact system is up to you, and will have to be manually maintained.</p>

<p>Generally I would recommend to have one folder per working project, plus a 'Misc' folder for all those great ideas that you have had which aren't strictly part of an already existing project (maybe they will become seeds of future projects).</p>

<p>I hope this helps a little and good luck organizing and sorting.</p>

I still mention it in case anyone on any of those platforms interested in the question ends up here, as the title doesn't mention the Linux-specificity. I wrote more about Scrivener in my answer to this question: Is there a special software for writers? 
A piece of software I heard is very similar in features, and is supported on the Linux platform as well, is Writer's Cafe. I cannot compare them myself, as I lack any experience with the latter, but it should be worth testing out.
Even though I cannot directly help with Linux software, I will elaborate on analog options. These will always be less streamlined than using dedicated software, as the organization has to be done manually.
The best way would be to have folders with printed out/jotted down text, organized by project. So, if you have a scene that you want to use in a certain project, only later on, get it on a piece of paper and file it in the folder. You then always know where to look. It is also a good idea to color-mark, or otherwise mark the papers for sub-sorting, and you can clip small cards with a synopses in the top corner for even more clarity. Again, the exact system is up to you, and will have to be manually maintained.
Generally I would recommend to have one folder per working project, plus a 'Misc' folder for all those great ideas that you have had which aren't strictly part of an already existing project (maybe they will become seeds of future projects).
I hope this helps a little and good luck organizing and sorting.
P.S. You can of course use boxes instead of folders, or anything else that suits you personally.

632,,,"<p>I used to love running on the beach. It was best in the winter, when the grey skies and cold air kept the beaches clear. <em>&lt; This is fine</em>.</p>

<p>Run as far as you could, marking the perfect sand with the print of your shoes, and then turning, and following your prints home. <em>&lt; This, on the other hand, is clumsy. It's something I'm terrible for, cramming too many concepts into one sentence. It causes problems because in this sentence you start with ""Run"" but then you are ""turning"". To stick with the concept it should read: Run as far as you can, marking the perfect sand with the print of your shoes, then turn and follow your prints home. Conceptually I would tend to mark the experience out differently. The joy of marking the perfect sand with your prints is one experience, the experience of following the prints home is entirely another. Both are equally valid in mood terms, so I would actually make care to give them each a separate sentence.</em></p>

<p>Alone with the waves and the birds. &lt; <em>Not a sentence. Also maybe ocean instead of waves? I realise the sensory intention is auditory. Also you come back to talking about yourself in the head of the next paragraph whereas you've just been saying ""you"". This sentence is trying to bring it back to I, sort of, and also adding another leayer of experience into the first paragraph.</em></p>

<p><em>Ironically I think that this first paragraph probably needs revising and expanding. You have a soup of concepts, experiences etc. and they're all running over one another. Concision is not just about being efficient it's also about choosing the appropriate amount of words for your communication. I think that you have more to say to set up the final paragraph. Maybe, like a person who is running in the sand the prose should start a bit slow and then rev up to pace itself into a clean finish.</em></p>

<p><em>If so I would go for a structure like Paragraph One: experiential paragraph talking about tactile things like sand in your toes. Paragraph two: mix the tactile with the auditory go from the wind whipping over your skin to the sound of the waves to the cries of the birds. Paragraph three: Finally, visual mixed with memories. Racing the storm and seeing the black thunderheads and the soupy water of the ocean. Just a suggestion for expansion should that be your desire.

Run as far as you could, marking the perfect sand with the print of your shoes, and then turning, and following your prints home. < This, on the other hand, is clumsy. It's something I'm terrible for, cramming too many concepts into one sentence. It causes problems because in this sentence you start with ""Run"" but then you are ""turning"". To stick with the concept it should read: Run as far as you can, marking the perfect sand with the print of your shoes, then turn and follow your prints home. Conceptually I would tend to mark the experience out differently. The joy of marking the perfect sand with your prints is one experience, the experience of following the prints home is entirely another. Both are equally valid in mood terms, so I would actually make care to give them each a separate sentence.
Alone with the waves and the birds. < Not a sentence. Also maybe ocean instead of waves? I realise the sensory intention is auditory. Also you come back to talking about yourself in the head of the next paragraph whereas you've just been saying ""you"". This sentence is trying to bring it back to I, sort of, and also adding another leayer of experience into the first paragraph.
Ironically I think that this first paragraph probably needs revising and expanding. You have a soup of concepts, experiences etc. and they're all running over one another. Concision is not just about being efficient it's also about choosing the appropriate amount of words for your communication. I think that you have more to say to set up the final paragraph. Maybe, like a person who is running in the sand the prose should start a bit slow and then rev up to pace itself into a clean finish.
If so I would go for a structure like Paragraph One: experiential paragraph talking about tactile things like sand in your toes. Paragraph two: mix the tactile with the auditory go from the wind whipping over your skin to the sound of the waves to the cries of the birds. Paragraph three: Finally, visual mixed with memories. Racing the storm and seeing the black thunderheads and the soupy water of the ocean. Just a suggestion for expansion should that be your desire. Then at least you will be able to shoot for a concise style while at the same time parcelling up what you are trying to get across by sensory experience across nicely flowing paragraphs.

651,,,"<p>No parent takes naming their child as an indifferent thing.  Before the baby is even born, the name we give the child is an <em>identity</em> that will stick with him/her for the rest of that baby's life.  Or to quote Orson Scott Card: ""A name is part of who a person is.  It's the label that stands for everything you've done and everything you are."" (Characters &amp; Viewpoint, p. 41)</p>

<p>I suggest taking a ""parental"" role to naming characters - just like a parent doesn't know who their child will ultimately be before they're born, that doesn't stop them from giving the baby a name.  An identity.  A label that stands for everything they are and have done and will do.</p>

<p>As for <em>how</em> you choose your names, here are some tips that I've found very helpful over the years:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Buy a naming book, like Sherrilyn
Kenyon's <em>Character Naming
Sourcebook</em> or a baby naming book. 
There are websites that help with
this, too.  I prefer books that give
meanings to the names (even though a
good sound is usually more important
than an appropriate meaning).</p></li>
<li><p><em>Sometimes</em> looking for an
appropriate meaning to a name can be
a starting point.  If a character is
brave, then looking for names that
suggest bravery or heroism in their
meaning can be good.  But I wouldn't
get too bogged down with that if you
don't find anything.</p></li>
<li><p>Think of a characters nationality
and ethnicity.  That will almost
always suggest certain names and cut
off others.  If your world is a
fantasy world, think of the speech
patterns you might like them to
exhibit.  Are their names more
""sing-songy"" or perhaps harsher? 
You can use (altered) real names to
create good sounding fantasy names. 
Russian or Polish might work well
for gutteral harsher races, if
that's what you're aiming for. 
Indian / Hindi names are more
flowing and pleasing to the ear. 
Irish names tend to suggest a gaiety
that make people smile.  These names
almost always draw certain images
into our minds, certain associations - which can be particularly helpful in establishing a mental picture of
the characters.</p></li>
<li><p>When you hear names that you
like, be sure to <em>write them down</em>. 
Keep a custom ""naming dictionary""
for yourself and update it as often
as possible with names you like.</p></li>
<li><p>If you can't think of a ""real""
name for a character just yet, then
try to think of a single nickname. 
It might suggest a real name to you.
If you do have a real name, I still
suggest thinking on whether there
are any good nicknames for the
character.  It adds to their
realism.</p></li>
<li><p>Vary the first letter of the main
characters' names, and try to vary
their syllables, as well.  If you
have two one syllable names, then
try not to use anymore of those - go
for two and three syllables.  That
will also help to narrow down the
field and suggest other names to
you.  This makes it easier for
readers to keep track of them, and
it also makes them more real.</p></li>
<li><p>The fact that somewhat more
common names remind you of people
you know isn't always bad. I have
noticed what I think are common
characteristics of the Rachels,
Jeffs, Mikes, Annas, etc. that I
know.  I've heard the same
observations from others, too.  You
don't have to copy your friends'
traits - but they might suggest some
characteristics that you hadn't
otherwise thought of.</p></li>
<li><p>If you're having difficult
getting past the names and the
strong associations with people you
know, you might try writing a list
of every single person you can think
of with a given name - friends,
family, celebrities, authors, etc. 
Instead of focusing on their common
characteristics (as in #7), focus on
all of their differences.  Put it
into your mind that, though they all
share the same name, they are all
individuals in their own right - and
so is your character who shares that
name, too!</p></li>
<li><p>If you have a particular
personality in mind for the
character, you have two options:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Choose a name that <em>sounds</em> like it fits.  A action powerhouse hero named Walter doesn't fit quite as well as Bruno or Mike.  A prim, proper, and beautiful princess would sound weird named Gretchen as opposed to, say, Allegra or Serena.</p></li>
<li><p>Do just the opposite.  Name the muscle strapped action hero Milford, Benedict, or Lawrence.  Though, if you do that, it should definitely be something that other characters poke fun at, or is seen as an oddity as some way or other.  The name becomes part of the character's identity in a way he might not necessarily enjoy.  Think Johnny Cash's <em>Boy Named Sue</em>.</p></li>

All you really need is a double character return. The reader barely notices it, but it's at least an indicator that we're changing character viewpoints. If you don't use the double return for anything else in your story, then the reader will quickly become accustomed to seeing it and knowing what's happening.</p>

<p>However, if you go for long stretches in one character's head, and then you decide to jump around a bit, and then you go for long stretches again without doing this, it will probably seem somewhat sloppy.

664,,,"<p>First person has the unfortunate side-effect of being <em>narrated</em> in an extreme sort of way. While it's true that the reader has more emotional investment (if done well) in the character, it can also be true that first person can potentially pull the reader out of the story over and over again with side comments that have little to do with what is currently taking place. That's not always bad, but if you have such interruptions (the thoughts of the narrator <em>as he's writing</em> rather than <em>as he's in the story</em>), then you <strong>HAVE</strong> to make up for it with an engaging writing style. Which is one of the greatest difficulties with first person. If you have such an engaging style, though, then by all means - go for it! If you slip-up, though, it will be much more noticeable and annoying to the reader. You can't just ""tell"" - you have to tell <em>as your character, who ought to be interesting and fun to listen to</em>.</p>

<p>Genres that especially employ first-person today tend to be more comedic or memoir-based.  If the reader goes in with a good laugh, or with the understanding that this is more like someone's diary, then they're willing to deal with occasional stints away from the immediate story when the narrator wants their attention.</p>

<p>There are actually two types of third-person to consider:</p>

<ul>
<li>Third-Person Omniscient: This allows you to jump from character to character, sharing thoughts and attitudes from all of them. This kind of story is usually much more action-based. You don't get deeply attached to the characters, but instead just want to know: ""What happens next?"" That doesn't mean the story or characters should be shallow; the reader will simply always be aware of an ever-present narrator (like in first-person), but without the close attachment to the characters. Good stories can be written from this viewpoint, but <em>very bad</em> ones can be, as well. It's not very popular today, especially since it doesn't emphasize character-driven stories as much as contemporary readers tend to like. A good choice for this one might be a ""setting-based story"" - like Tolkien's <em>Lord of the Rings</em>.</li>
<li>Third-Person Limited: Most modern stories are written from this viewpoint. It has the strength of being much closer to one person in the story (like first person) while also engaging the action in a way that can be difficult with first. Plus, if your prose isn't the greatest, many ""literary sins"" will be forgiven by writing in the third-person. A great style is always good, but it's not <em>as</em> necessary in third as it is in first, and the reader will be more willing to forgive you for some slip-ups.

666,,,"<p>I actually disagree about as heartily with the marked answer to this question as it is possible to. First person does not, in fact, make you emotionally closer to the narrator. A lesson I learned the hard way when I wrote an entire novel in the first person only to have the chief criticism come back at me that the main character seemed whiny and self-obsessed; when I was looking for cool and distant but ultimately virtuous and heroic.</p>

<p>It was at that point that the room (for the criticism was delivered in an eight-person writer's circle and the one thing seven people could agree upon was that my heroine was a whiner) dissected the uses of first person perspective. We discovered the following things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Men cannot, in general, write female first-person. One of the few examples of success is Stephen King's ""Dolores Claiborne"". Most other attempts have failed. Draw your own conclusions as to why this might be.</li>
<li>The main purpose of first-person is to tell stories in a technique known as ""the unreliable witness"". ""The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time"" is an example where the viewpoint character is understood by the reader to have a high-level of autism and the author attempts to relay the experience as the narrator experiences it. The reader can then interpret what is ""really"" happening for themselves. In third person it is presumed that, even if the author is not using third person omniscient, there is some objective truth to reported thoughts, actions and events. In ""third person limited"" sentences like ""Bob would not even admit to himself..."" may be used to tell the reader about things that even the viewpoint character does not know about their own state of mind. The unreliable witness, on the other hand, expects the author to write in a voice as if they are the viewpoint character. The reader must infer the things Bob doesn't want to admit to himself by reading between the lines.</li>
<li>Some would argue that there is a neutral form of first-person in which the viewpoint character is a witness, but not an unreliable one. In fact, the most powerful way to utilise first-person in this mode is when the viewpoint character is a ""rube"" someone who is naive and does not understand the full implications of the situation in which they find themselves. Pulp thrillers of the 30s, 40s and 50s often used this technique because limiting story to one viewpoint allows for punchy efficiency. The main characters in pulp stories are often rubes who are being played for fools by their clients and the antagonists. This tends to creep in to any first-person narrative that isn't explicitly intended to utilise an unreliable witness. Note that the narrator remains an unreliable witness if only because they are never privy to all the information necessary to inject the situation with any measure of objectivity. For example, other characters the viewpoint character meets can have their descriptions coloured by the supposed mood of the viewpoint character.</li>
</ol>

<p>For these reasons it tends to be the case that reading a novel in third person limited becomes a more intimate experience for readers in which they can more easily become attached to the characters and hence feel more positively about them.</p>

<p>In first person the reader is encouraged to form an opinion about the narrator as a very distinct and separate person from them. In a pulp thriller the side-effects of this are minimal because people really mostly care about what is happening to the hero as opposed to being encouraged to care about the hero themselves for purely emotional reasons.</p>

<p>In fact if a viewpoint character in first person keeps referencing how they feel it tends to come across as whining. Thus it is encouraged to keep first-person novels on a lighter less personal basis. For this reason we have to work out a viewpoint character's motivations, feelings, shortcomings that they are unaware of etc for ourselves. This additional burden on the reader to recontextualise the story subtracting the viewpoint character's personal quirks is a distancing experience absent from third-person limited.</p>

<p>Ever since that writer's circle session I have been very careful about employing first-person perspective and would now only do it if I had a very specific reason to convey an unreliable witness or a rube perspective. Generally speaking heroes of genre do not come across as sympathetically in first-person as third. I would not use the first-person to portray a heroic character because nothing takes the shine off a hero like getting deep inside their internal monologue. In third person limited it is much easier to excuse a hero's shortcomings as ""features of their personality"". In third person it is easier to root for a deeply flawed hero. First person viewpoint characters tend to seem more flawed no matter how much they are outwardly a paragon of virtue.</p>

668,,,"<p>A very ""simple"" way is to distract the reader. For example the hero(es) are sent to kill a demon. It hides in a church which is full of ""good"" symbols. There are powerful spells to prevent entrance but none of them lethal. Since everyone concentrates so much on the goal (destroy evil), they don't notice that they destroy a place which has been built by the good forces to fight evil - and that their employer is in fact the demon they were sent to destroy.</p>

<p>All the time, the hero(es) will wonder how the demon could ""spoil"" such a place.

<p>So what you need is to run <em>two</em> stories alongside each other. One is what the characters see and one is what is really happening. You show the reader one and glimpses of the other (as the characters encounter them). Or you can add a character that lies, plain and simple. Small lies tend to get overlooked because people aren't 100% perfect.</p>

670,,,"<p>In contrast to others here, I don't think specific edit questions are appropriate for this site, so I will answer your question in a general (do-it-yourself) way:</p>

<p>This is a method from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_Eschbach"" rel=""nofollow"">Andreas Eschbach</a>. If you know German, read the <a href=""http://www.andreaseschbach.de/schreiben/page96/page96.html"" rel=""nofollow"">original text</a>.<br>
I will only summarise it here:</p>

<p>First print out your text (yes, you need it on paper). Pick a small text passage you can easily overview and go through all of the following 10 points with this passage. Then pick the next one. Use different colours for marking your text and for editing it.</p>

<p>The 10 marking steps by Andreas Eschbach:</p>

<ol>
<li>Strike through the first paragraph of a scene from upper left to lower right.<br>
<em>Think</em>: Do you really need it? Often the first paragraph is used to ""warming up"" while writing. Could you put the info into later sections?</li>
<li>Strike through all adjectives and adverbs<br>
<em>Think</em>: Can you use a more precise noun/verb instead using the adjectives/adverbs?</li>
<li>Mark all dialog decorators (like he said, he replied, ...) with wavy lines.<br>
<em>Think</em>: Can you delete them without puzzling the user? Can you replace them with actions (instead of: ""Are you sure?"" asked Peter => use: ""Are you sure?"" Peter scratched his head. He couldn't believe what he was hearing.)?</li>
<li>Mark filler words and imprecise words (some, quite, rather, several, few, ...) by drawing a box around them.<br>
<em>Think</em>: Normally you can just delete them or make them more precise (Only a few people ... => Only ten people ...)</li>

This is a method from Andreas Eschbach. If you know German, read the original text.
I will only summarise it here:
First print out your text (yes, you need it on paper). Pick a small text passage you can easily overview and go through all of the following 10 points with this passage. Then pick the next one. Use different colours for marking your text and for editing it.
The 10 marking steps by Andreas Eschbach:

Strike through the first paragraph of a scene from upper left to lower right.
Think: Do you really need it? Often the first paragraph is used to ""warming up"" while writing. Could you put the info into later sections?
Strike through all adjectives and adverbs
Think: Can you use a more precise noun/verb instead using the adjectives/adverbs?
Mark all dialog decorators (like he said, he replied, ...) with wavy lines.
Think: Can you delete them without puzzling the user? Can you replace them with actions (instead of: ""Are you sure?"" asked Peter => use: ""Are you sure?"" Peter scratched his head. He couldn't believe what he was hearing.)?
Mark filler words and imprecise words (some, quite, rather, several, few, ...) by drawing a box around them.
Think: Normally you can just delete them or make them more precise (Only a few people ... => Only ten people ...)
Cross out concurrency indicators (during, while, ...)
Think: Often it could be better to write things that happen simultaneously in two different sentences: ""She cried while he beat her."" => ""He beat her. She cried.""
Mark passive sentences with a small ""P"" above them.
Think: Often the active form is better (more action): New Orleans was devastated by a hurricane. => The hurricane devastated New Orleans.
Mark long sentences with an ""L"" above the sentence.
Think: Make them shorter! No-one likes to read long sentences (except your English teacher in school maybe).
Mark long dialogs with an ""LD"".
Think: Can you shorten them or divide them into several parts?
Mark indirect perception with a jagged line, like ""watched"" and ""asked"" in these examples:
""He watched, how the woman crossed the street joining the spectators there. He asked himself, what was going on there.""
Think: Do you really need it? Why? Does this sound better: ""He watched the spectators on the other side. Another woman crossed the street to join them. What was going on there?""
Search paragraphs where you wrote the same thing with different wording. Mark it with wavy lines at the sheet margin:
""She hit him a second time. Another time she stroke the club on his head.""
Think: This looks like you were searching for the right expression while writing. Nothing wrong with that, but only keep one of them.

After you have done that, you have to edit your text according to these markings. Main goal: Deleting! Get rid of the crap!
Then take your correction and read it aloud. Does it sound good? No? Change it!

<ul>
<li>Armchair Mystery - general mystery, but with less sex and violence and milder language</li>
<li>Chick-Lit - not a traditional romance, but often centered on love and sex</li>
<li>Children's - target ages of seven to twelve years old</li>
<li>Erotica - explicit sex</li>
<li>Fantasy - Worlds other than our own, often involving wizardry and/or fantastic beasts</li>
<li>Historical Romance - non-contemporary, prehistory to early twentieth century</li>
<li>Horror - supernatural or real, antagonist terrorizes other characters</li>
<li>Legal Thriller - plot centers around a trial</li>
<li>Literary - writing viewed as more sophisticated, Pulitzer Prize level</li>
<li>Mainstream - crossed out of a genre into popular readership</li>
<li>Military Thriller - action, adventure, suspense set in military life</li>
<li>Mystery - centers on solving a crime</li>
<li>Romance - centers on relationship of two people who fall in love</li>
<li>Science Fiction - set in future reality, includes technology</li>
<li>Suspense - suspenseful drama with dark threat</li>
<li>Western - non-contemporary adventure in the American West</li>

<p>Re: individual scene typing within a genre category</p>

<p>As a reader, I have never considered the specific type of a scene separate from the genre of the work.  I asked my wife about this and she has never thought this way either.  It is much more important that a scene fit the characters and story as a whole regardless of type.  For example, just because two people in love are having a dialog doesn't mean that scene has to follow a traditional romance scene formula if the overall genre is something else.  Let the actions of the characters determine individual scene direction instead of trying to fit them into set formulaic molds.</p>

<p>Three installments of Neil Gaiman's <em>Sandman</em> graphic novel concern <strong>William Shakespeare</strong> and the act of writing: more specifically, <em><a href=""http://gestaltmash.com/2010/10/sandman-meditations-men-of-good-fortune/"" rel=""nofollow"">Men of Good Fortune</a></em>, <em><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman%3a_Dream_Country#A_Midsummer_Night.27s_Dream"" rel=""nofollow"">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a></em> and <em><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sandman%3a_The_Wake#.22The_Tempest.22"" rel=""nofollow"">The Tempest</a></em> are three issues that concern The Bard and his deal with Morpheus. This mini-arc echoes throughout the rest of the 75-installment tale and concerns preserving great stories, and the sort of immortality an artist can achieve. My favorite line from the entire work is ""The price of getting what you want, is getting what you once wanted."" (Typed from memory.) </p>

<p>I'll round this out with a fictional example: <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilgore_Trout"" rel=""nofollow"">Kilgore Trout</a></strong> is perhaps the most well-known hack writer in American literature. <strong>Kurt Vonnegut</strong>'s creation was actually based on Theodore Sturgeon, and the character's most significant appearance is in Breakfast of Champions, where he finds out that he is the creation of another writer, and he <a href=""http://www.vonnegutweb.com/vonnegutia/trout/kt_interview.html"" rel=""nofollow"">meets his maker near the end of the novel</a>. Trout writes what seems would be terrible stories, and has published dozens of them in his life. However, he has his fans, who seek out their idol's work in porn shops and bargain bins. This endlessly fascinating character has written books he's never even seen a copy of, but are published <em>somewhere</em>. The message seems to be that life is a pointless farce, and there is no message except for what we may read into it. Life may be dreary, but let's laugh at it anyway! </p>

<p>I also find that, while I'm reading any story with Kilgore Trout in it, I find myself more conscious that this is a book written by a writer, and that these are words on a page. I somehow still care about the characters, especially the ""minor"", insignificant bit-parts.  </p>

<p>Sooner or later, I think most artists will create a work that's meta to at least some degree.

<p>Typically, you would begin querying agents.  Agents offer a number of benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some will help you polish up your novel further</li>
<li>They know the marketplace and have access to editors at publishing houses.  <em>Many publishing houses these days refuse to look at unsolicited manuscripts sent by the author.</em>  If they're good at their job, they'll have an idea of which editors will be most receptive to your work.  </li>
<li>They will help you with the contractual complexities of publishing, which are very complex indeed.  What sort of publishing rights are you selling?  To whom, and for how much?  Will they revert back to you if your book goes out of print?  Etc., etc.</li>
<li>They will support you in myriad other ways.</li>
</ul>

<p>The cost of an agent is a commission on your work, <strong>if</strong> it sells (and not before!).  Usually this amounts to 15%.</p>

<p><em>EDIT:</em> As MGOwen points out, there are some incompetent and/or exploitative people in the agenting business too.  <a href=""http://pred-ed.com"">Preditors and Editors</a> is an award-winning website that can help you check up on agents to make sure they're on the up-and-up.  You should also look for agents that are members of AAR - the Association of Author's Representatives.  This is the primary professional organization for literary agents.</p>

<p>Querying an agent usually involves sending a query letter and the first few (rarely more than 5) pages as a sample.  Agents will specify the exact format they desire, and they will almost all be slightly different.  <a href=""http://www.writersmarket.com"">Writers Market</a> is one of the better-known resources for agent listings.  Note that they are a paid service.  (They also have print editions).  For the most part, agencies are all on the web these days, and they should describe their preferred formats on their site.</p>

<p>A great resource for learning about how to craft effective query letters is <a href=""http://queryshark.blogspot.com"">Query Shark</a>.  <a href=""http://misssnark.blogspot.com"">Miss Snark's Blog</a> also says quite a bit on the subject (though that blog is no longer updated).  I'm sure there are other good resources out there too, if you do a little searching.</p>

<p>If your query piques the interest of the agent, they will usually request a ""partial"" - basically a larger chunk of your manuscript, like 30 to 50 pages.  Then, if they still like what they're seeing, they'll request the whole thing.</p>

<p>Finally, if the agent likes the entire work, they will offer representation.  Alternately, they may ask to see a rewrite <em>before</em> offering representation.

<p>Once you've signed a contract with the agent and gone through any revision, they'll begin shopping your book around.  Hopefully everyone loves it, there's a huge multi-house auction, and you can retire!</p>

<h2>Alternatives</h2>

<p>While querying agents is the most well-known way to get a book into print, there are alternatives you can explore.</p>

<p>Some publishers will accept queries or full manuscripts.  You may choose to submit directly to these publishers.  Small presses may be more likely to look at your unrepresented work.  If your book does garner interest, you may choose to deal with contract negotiations and the rest of the business side of publishing on your own.  A better alternative is probably to get an agent at this point.  It won't be hard when you tell them you already have a publisher who wants to buy your book.</p>

<p>Another option, ""Vanity""/self-publishing, is more popular than ever.  <strong>Be extremely wary, however!</strong>  ""Vanity"" publishers will disguise themselves as small presses, large presses, and anything else they think will get you to fork over your hard-earned cash.  In traditional publishing, the money always flows <em>toward the author</em>.  If you see anything about up-front fees, you're typically looking at a vanity publisher.  Most of these businesses make their money from authors, who pay significant sums to have their books published.</p>

<p>If your main concern is seeing your book in bound form, and you don't mind paying for it, this path may be for you. Just be aware of what you're getting into.  Vanity presses make their money from authors, so they have little incentive to actually sell books.  They offer no marketing support, and your book will not generally be stocked on bookstore shelves or get reviews.  Most books published through these companies sell only a handful of copies.  It <em>is</em> possible to sell large quantities through self-publishing, but it generally requires a lot of hard work on the author's part, promoting and marketing.  A platform, such as speaking engagements, can also help.  Even then, it's a bit of a long-shot.</p>

<p>Finally, print-on-demand is an emerging alternative which allows books to be printed one-by-one, rather than in large runs.  Companies that offer this service typically take a cut of each book sold, and are able to remain profitable by keeping minimal inventory.</p>

<p>Publishing through print-on-demand shares some of the pitfalls of ""vanity"" press, namely the lack of any support from the publisher.

You'll learn SO MUCH from writing two or three, that it will help you to go back and make your first one even better (or, if you're like me, recognize it for the heap of rotting garbage that it is and toss it).  As far as I know, it is incredibly rare for someone to sell their first novel.  And I've read on more than once occasion that this is a good thing.

<p>Everyone is different, but you can learn which one you are (or rather, where you sit on the continuum between the two extremes) by <strong>trying both</strong>. </p>

<p>For example:</p>

"
689,,,"<p>John Smithers's comment is spot-on.  Start writing now, and you can work on being a better writer as you go.  It's like running competitively.  Professional runners run a lot, every single day.  They don't worry too much about if they're reading the right books about running, they just practice.  Practice writing, then practice editing what you wrote, again and again.  </p>

<p>That said, there are a lot of resources out there that can make a fine supplement to your writing practice.  A couple of my favorites:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.hatrack.com/writingclass/index.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">Uncle Orson's Writing Class</a> - A series of short essays on various writing topics by Orson Scott Card.</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.intergalacticmedicineshow.com/cgi-bin/mag.cgi?do=columns&amp;vol=mette_ivie_harrison&amp;article=_index"" rel=""nofollow"">Chopsticks</a> - Writing Advice by Mette Ivie Harrison</li>
</ul>

Practice writing, then practice editing what you wrote, again and again.  
That said, there are a lot of resources out there that can make a fine supplement to your writing practice.  A couple of my favorites:

Uncle Orson's Writing Class - A series of short essays on various writing topics by Orson Scott Card.

<p><strong>This may very well be the most popular ""rule"" of writing.  It refers to the idea that it's better to ""show"" an event as a scene, rather than simply ""telling"" the reader what happened.</strong></p>

<p>In my opinion, this is mostly sound advice:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Don't <em>tell</em> us the 5000-year history of your fantasy setting in the prologue.  <em>Show</em> it to us throughout the story.</li>
<li>Don't <em>tell</em> us the protagonist's girlfriend is beautiful.  <em>Show</em> us her flowing black hair, her lips perpetually on the verge of smiling, her brown eyes with those eerie golden flecks.</li>
<li>Don't <em>tell</em> us the thief was nervous.  <em>Show</em> us how he has to close his eyes and breathe, just to stop his hands from shaking.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, sometimes there is information that the reader needs to know to understand the story, but forcing that information into a scene would divert the plot or bore the reader to tears.</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't <em>show</em> us the Senators explaining to each other how the seat of US government is Washington D.C.  They have no reason to tell each other what they already know.  Instead, just <em>tell</em> us.</li>
<li>Don't <em>show</em> the young wizard taking a tour of the magical staff factory, when he has no business being there.  Just <em>tell</em> us that all magical staves are carved from the wood of the whump-whump tree.</li>

729,,,"<p>I can't really comment accurately on your particular examples, but royalties and payments can become quite complicated.</p>

<p>For example, there is often an <em>advance against royalties</em> to consider initially.  This advance is up-front money for the author, and is typically paid when the book goes to print.  I have read that publishers will often shoot for an advance to equal what they expect author royalties to be in the first year the book is out.  However, bigger names get larger advances, and a good agent may be able to wheedle a slightly better one as well.</p>

<p>When royalties start coming in, they first go against the advance.  (If the book never sells enough copies for the royalties to reach the advance amount, the author still keeps the full advance.) Until the author profit reaches that advance number, they don't actually see any of it.  Once the author's earnings exceed the advance, they'll begin getting payments on a schedule.</p>

<p>Royalties can also be tiered, meaning that if you sell X number of books, the royalty rate increases, and if you sell Y books above that, it increases again, and so on.</p>

<p>Further, the royalty rate depends largely on the type of print run.  Hardcovers have higher royalties (and higher prices), so hardcover runs will be more profitable at an equal number of sales.  Trade paperbacks typically have lower royalty rates, and mass market paperbacks even lower.  Adding to the complication is that a book that has an initial hardcover run is often reprinted a while later in one or more paperback forms.</p>

<p>E-books are still a new product, and as such, the rates are in subject to fluctuate.  E-books may be released simultaneously with hardcover or paperback editions, or separately, and their pricing varies considerably depending on that release timing, the publisher, the author's name, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos"" rel=""nofollow"">Jeff Bezos's</a> mood and the current celestial alignments.</p>

<p>Some ""average"" royalty rates, that you should take with a grain of salt, for all the reasons already stated:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hardcover: 10 - 15%</li>
<li>Paperback (Trade and Mass Market): 7.5 - 12.5%</li>
<li>E-books: 25% (many in the biz suspect this could soon go as high as 40%)</li>

738,798,10,"<p>I am a planner in the extreme. I tend to drift toward fantasy oriented novels when writing; it's just what comes out. This means that I do quite a bit of planning for the world that the story will be set in. I know that's not a bad thing, but I have noticed that I have a tendency to get bogged down in specific events - especially historical events. I'll find myself describing entire battles or diplomatic missions or even important local events as though they were the story itself - and almost none of that is <em>ever</em> going to even show up in the story!</p>

<p>I really enjoy that preparation, but eventually my notes become so unwieldy, it's hard to actually sit down and write the story while keeping it all straight. Not to mention that it's kind of wasting time when I could be writing.</p>

<p>My questions are: Is there a helpful way to gauge when ""enough is enough""? How do I put an end to this world builder's syndrome I've got? Or at least keep it in check? Does anyone have any advice on how know when it might be necessary to do some more fleshed-out preparation and when it's just wasting time (and accumulating too many notes)?</p>

<p>By the way, my average preparation results in something on the order of 150,000+ words (the most I've ever written is 300,000). In other words, I consistently find myself writing a novel before I even write my novel. And I <em>know</em> it's hindering more than helping me. I just don't even realize I'm doing it most of the time until it's too late.</p>

I tend to drift toward fantasy oriented novels when writing; it's just what comes out. This means that I do quite a bit of planning for the world that the story will be set in. I know that's not a bad thing, but I have noticed that I have a tendency to get bogged down in specific events - especially historical events. I'll find myself describing entire battles or diplomatic missions or even important local events as though they were the story itself - and almost none of that is ever going to even show up in the story!
I really enjoy that preparation, but eventually my notes become so unwieldy, it's hard to actually sit down and write the story while keeping it all straight. Not to mention that it's kind of wasting time when I could be writing.
My questions are: Is there a helpful way to gauge when ""enough is enough""? How do I put an end to this world builder's syndrome I've got? Or at least keep it in check? Does anyone have any advice on how know when it might be necessary to do some more fleshed-out preparation and when it's just wasting time (and accumulating too many notes)?
By the way, my average preparation results in something on the order of 150,000+ words (the most I've ever written is 300,000). In other words, I consistently find myself writing a novel before I even write my novel. And I know it's hindering more than helping me. I just don't even realize I'm doing it most of the time until it's too late.

<li>Replace ""John <em>ran quickly</em>"" with ""John <em>sprinted</em>.""</li>

(Almost.) We suspend disbelief, but Holmes and Bond are firmly two-dimensional. Does your character have vulnerabilities that would make them three-dimensional and believable?  </li>
<li>Can this character have reasonably picked up these skills within a normal human lifetime?  Is it believable that this character has skill A <em>as well as</em> skill B, and so on? If the skills are somehow related, you'll have an easier time selling them to the reader. </li>
</ul>

<p>You have a few options when it comes to fleshing out such a character. </p>

<ul>
<li>Rewrite the character to either take out a few skills, or better yet, make the character a little shaky in some of them. Why should life be easy? If all problems are solvable, there's less conflict and danger. The skilled pilot is less interesting than the guy who's taken a few lessons having to <em>land that plane</em>. </li>
<li>Cast the character as two or more characters. That introduces other problems, and could kill any momentum you've got going. </li>
<li>Add some backstory to make these skills believable. Be careful with this one; you want to hint at why the protagonist knows how to fix a jet engine with a Leatherman <em>while it's running</em>, not tell an unrelated story about that time in a B-52 flying over hostile territory with an enemy agent trying to sabotage the mission. See how distracting that is? A fun backstory can easily take away from the main story unless it's very carefully crafted to move the main plot forward.  </li>
<li>Ask yourself, since this character has picked up skills [foo], what would have driven someone to know all these things? </li>
</ul>

<p>If you still can't make up your mind about whether or not you have <a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MarySue"">a problem character</a> in your story, you could decide to temporarily not worry about it, take advantage of the momentum you have going and finish the book, put it in a drawer, and look at it with fresh eyes in a week or two.

Can this character have reasonably picked up these skills within a normal human lifetime?  Is it believable that this character has skill A as well as skill B, and so on? If the skills are somehow related, you'll have an easier time selling them to the reader. 

You have a few options when it comes to fleshing out such a character. 

Rewrite the character to either take out a few skills, or better yet, make the character a little shaky in some of them. Why should life be easy? If all problems are solvable, there's less conflict and danger. The skilled pilot is less interesting than the guy who's taken a few lessons having to land that plane. 
Cast the character as two or more characters. That introduces other problems, and could kill any momentum you've got going. 
Add some backstory to make these skills believable. Be careful with this one; you want to hint at why the protagonist knows how to fix a jet engine with a Leatherman while it's running, not tell an unrelated story about that time in a B-52 flying over hostile territory with an enemy agent trying to sabotage the mission. See how distracting that is? A fun backstory can easily take away from the main story unless it's very carefully crafted to move the main plot forward.  
Ask yourself, since this character has picked up skills [foo], what would have driven someone to know all these things? 

If you still can't make up your mind about whether or not you have a problem character in your story, you could decide to temporarily not worry about it, take advantage of the momentum you have going and finish the book, put it in a drawer, and look at it with fresh eyes in a week or two. (Number one piece of advice for writers: keep writing!) 
All this advice is a shot in the dark without reading your work, of course, so please read this with several large salt licks handy.

[ new user, so I can only post one link - google it! ]</p>

<p>There are a lot of 'baby naming' websites out there; they tend to be pretty poor quality and unhelpful, but others may have better luck.</p>

<p>As for fantasy names, Tolkien was a linguist (or 'philologist' as they said then), and the reason there is such a strong consistency in the names is that they are part of languages he not only spent a long time on, but applied his knowledge of real languages to them.

<p>One of the first books I wrote as a teenager, I actually did this. I just wrote down an outline first; pencil on paper. Not chapter by chapter, but event by event. When a major event came to mind, I would use the top-level outline numbering and indent level, and then drill down into what would transpire. It was a great exercise to help train my mind how to write books.</p>

<p>I hate to say it, but if you're writing a story, don't be afraid to just outright use a formula. I don't do this any more, but have certainly used it as a mechanism to help get ideas out when I was younger. Just think about how you think the basic story should flow, and then fill in the blanks with passes of ever-increasing detail, sketchy outline, detailed outline, rough draft of events, piece together into short stories, and then craft a draft novel (or series, depending on the amount of stuff you're covering).</p>

<p>When it comes to an author's style, you have a lot of leeway. When an editor reads over the manuscript, they're going to make sure that what you've written is understandable and isn't going to throw your readers for a loop. If the editor has a hard time understanding what you're trying to say, they'll most likely ask you to change it. But if what you're saying is easily understandable and you just have a unique way you want to say it, then they'll most likely go with what you've got. Editors at publishing houses are also readers, they know what other reads are going to want to read and they know what sells.

<p>The most obvious and effective way is to show them that you're a professional. Make sure your manuscript and cover letter has been proofread and edited. Make sure there aren't any typos or glaring editing problems, those are sure signs that you're not a professional. Make sure you have a neutral third party go over your manuscript and give opinions and look for errors. Your close family and friend don't count, they're going to tell you the love it and that's not what you need. Never /ever/ send them a first draft. You should go through at least a half dozen drafts before you even consider sending it to a publisher.</p>

<p>The next step is to make sure you do your homework about the publisher. Make sure they accept the genre of manuscript you have. Don't send a mystery publisher your romance novel. Also make sure that they are accepting manuscripts. Some publishes only accept new submissions at certain times of the year.</p>

<p>If the publisher does reject your manuscript, move on. Don't try and argue with them, you're not going to win and you'll be making sure that they never want to publish anything of yours. And publisher do speak to each other. Especially in the smaller houses, at lot of staff work for multiple publishers. So if you make an ass out of yourself to Publisher A, and they happen to work for Publisher B and C as well, you can bet they've passed along the memo to them not to consider you.

But it might not matter. Stephanie Meyer knows sweet fuck-all about Native Americans, but that didn't stop her from exploiting them ruthlessly in her novels and she's doing alright.

<p>Writing and typesetting are separate activities that are not relevant to each other.

<p>It can also be a trap. You can get into a thing of turning the formatting decisions into a major part of your creative effort.

822,892,8,"<p>I'm not delusional about the nature of the science fiction novel I'm (very) slowly working on. A brief run down might be as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set 10's of millennia in Human's future but in a neighbouring  galaxy</li>
<li>Discovery of ancient artifact</li>
<li>Artifact turns violent on the discoverers</li>
<li>More discoveries by different people</li>
<li>Non-human race who built them come back to claim ownership of the galaxy from inhabitants (through violence, they believed they ""owned"" it and placed beacons when they left due to their own reasons)</li>
<li>Seriously technologically advanced</li>
<li>Benevolent race who lived around the same time appear to aid humans as they foresaw this happening</li>
<li>Bilbo Baggins lives happily ever after to the end of his days.</li>
</ul>

<p>This isn't a review of my particular story/plot, but I was wondering if it's really so bad to end up (by accident, you might say) with a plot that, while unique, has been done similarly before? Even though I feel I could do my particular idea justice, I can't help but notice it becoming more and more generic as I think about it.</p>

<p>Should I try to differentiate it as much as possible to the ""generic"" or just <em>get on with it</em>?</p>

823,,,"<p>You will find, if you look over all the novels you have ever read, there are key similarities. These will not be in the specifics in the individual plots, but in the paths they take. How many movies do you think encorporate 'Boy meets girl. Something bad happens and it looks like it isn't to be. They reconcile. Cue credits'. </p>

<p>The reason this happens is because that is how plots tend to lend themselves to concluding. It's only natural, really. There can be either a happy ending, or a sad ending, and anything too far removed does seem out of place. </p>

<p>I'm not suggesting you have to stick to cliche storylines, but if that is how your plot unfolds, let it happen. </p>
